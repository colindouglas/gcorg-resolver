"""Update gc_org_aliases.csv with new aliases from gc_concordance.csv.

Reads the existing aliases file first, then scans the concordance for new
aliases to add. Existing aliases are never removed or modified — only new
normalized forms that aren't already in the file get appended.

For each row in the Names and Codes dataset, the following fields are treated
as alias sources: harmonized_name, nom_harmonisé, abbreviation, abreviation,
ati, open_gov_ouvert. Duplicate normalized forms are resolved according to the
KNOWN_CONFLICTS dictionary or, if they're not known, the first value is
accepted and we print a message for attention later.
