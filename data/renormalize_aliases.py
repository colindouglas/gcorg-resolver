"""Re-normalize the ``name`` column in gc_org_aliases.csv.

Run this after changing the rules in ``gcorg_resolver.normalize`` so the
checked-in aliases file reflects the new normalization. Re-normalizing may
cause two previously distinct aliases to collapse to the same string:

- If they point to the same gc_orgID, the duplicate is dropped silently.
- If they point to different gc_orgIDs, the first occurrence wins and the
  conflict is printed so it can be resolved by hand (typically by adding an
  entry to KNOWN_CONFLICTS in update_aliases.py).

Rows whose name normalizes to an empty string are dropped.
