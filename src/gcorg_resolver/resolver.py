"""Resolve free-text organization names to a ``gc_orgID``.

Exact match first: normalize the input with the same pipeline used to build
``data/gc_org_aliases.csv`` and look the result up in an in-memory index.
On a miss, fall back to a string-distance search against the aliases — but
only when the normalized query is long enough that fuzzy matching is safe.
Short tokens like abbreviations are too easy to confuse and stay exact-only.
